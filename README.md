## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

In this challenge I managed to understand how the interactive elements work using hover in the css, I also managed to implement some shadows in the layout of the information box, which makes a good impression at first glance

```css
.card {
box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) 0px 19px 38px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.22) 0px 15px 12px;
}
```
```css
.overlay:hover {
    background-color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%) ;
    opacity: 0.7;
    transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
```
